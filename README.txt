READ ME - In order to run this file you must compile it with the makefile by simply typing make, then the Usage is ./word-count filename.txt
where filename is the file to be read by the program in order to fulfill the requirements.

In order to run the unit tests, you must compile as such gcc Unit-tests.c wordsProcessorLL.c -c, or to the object specified

As a reminder I ended up adding the unique word frequency requirements, and if I can get the points for that it would be appreciated
